Built with next.js, next-auth and material-ui icons (next css modules styling because it's more detail rich than tailwindcss which i began with)
Backend: google firebase.

Uses SSR as well as custom react hooks.

This project was more UI/design orientated rather than functional, eventhough I wrote some functions to add, edit and remove items, I could have, easily, made it more advanced.
